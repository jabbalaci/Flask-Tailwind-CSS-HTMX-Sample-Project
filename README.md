# A Flask + Tailwind CSS + HTMX Sample Project

In this sample project we demonstrate how to use **Flask** 
together with **Tailwind CSS** and **HTMX**.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment and install the
dependencies. Dependencies can be found in
the file `pyproject.toml`.
This project was created with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but you don't have to use it.
Dependencies can be installed with `pip` too.

Open a terminal, activate the virt. env., and launch
`make run`.

Open a second terminal, activate the virt. env., and launch `make css`.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
